## Description and Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to make a web application for my college class. The description of what my project should accomplish is for staff/employees to be able to manage a hotel. Such things can be
done by staff include creating a room and adding/removing amenities to a room, tracking rooms by their room number for 2 separate buildings, seeing and controlling the status of a room (closed, occupied, being cleaned, or 
reserved), check customers in with their personal details, and record a person's check-out time for when an employee needs to flag a room for cleaning.


## Prior Art
No prior art really just an idea from a friend.


## Core User Workflows
- Staff can check in/check out a customer
  - adds personal details to check-in (name, age, license number, room number, check-in time)
  - records when a customer checks out of their room and flags that room for cleaning

- Search rooms and room status
  - should be able to search for a room by their room number
  - should be able to see the status of the room (occupied, reserved, etc...)
  - should be able to edit the status of the room if a change occurs

- Staff can create/update/delete information on a room or the room itself
  - can create rooms
  - can update existing rooms
  - can remove a room if necessary
  - can add a detail box of a room (e.g.: this room has a great view for customers who want a good view)
 
TBA - login/logout system for staff, potential online user implementation (such as reserving a room online and paying for amenities)
